tinc	1.0.35_3	tinc is a Virtual Private Network (VPN) daemon that uses tunnelling and encryption to create a secure private network between hosts on the Internet. Because the tunnel appears to the IP level network code as a normal network device, there is no need to adapt any existing software. This tunnelling allows VPN sites to share information with each other over the Internet without exposing any information to others. A single tinc daemon can accept more than one connection at a time, thus making it possible to create larger virtual networks, because some limitations are circumvented. Instead of most other VPN implementations, tinc encapsulates each network packet in its own UDP packet, instead of encapsulating all into one TCP or even PPP over TCP stream. This results in lower latencies, less overhead, and in general better responsiveness and throughput. LICENSE: GPL3 or later with execption to link with OpenSSL

Package Dependencies:
  tinc-1.0.36_2

WireGuard is designed as a general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers alike, fit for many different circumstances. Initially released for the Linux kernel, it is now cross-platform and widely deployable. It is currently under heavy development, but already it might be regarded as the most secure, easiest to use, and simplest VPN solution in the industry.
